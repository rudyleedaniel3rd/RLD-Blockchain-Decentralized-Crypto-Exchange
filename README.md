# Blockchain Defi Project 

This project demonstrates a Blockchain, Ethereum, Solodity & Hardhat use case. It comes with a smart contract, a test for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
